# OSeMOSYS_linopy

A Linopy implementation of OSeMOSYS

This is a translation of the long version of OSeMOSYS.

Still a work in progress, there is a lot of work remaining to:

- [ ] Write tests for each of the constraints
- [ ] Write masks for variables
- [ ] Implement salvage values
- [ ] Refactor and add docstrings for each of the constraint blocks, including mathematical formulation
